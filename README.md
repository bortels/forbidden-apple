Things Apple doesn't let in their curated iOS and OS X stores

Apple's App stores are a mixed bag - it's nice to have someone at least trying to keep the malware
and crapware out, but - they restrict some types of apps, which is a bummer. I understand why - but
it's still a bummer.

For OS X - it's not a big deal, you don't need to get your software from their App Store. For iOS - until
now, if Apple didn't approve, you were out of luck unless you wanted to Jailbreak. Jailbreaking is fun,
but can be ugly - it is very unsupported, and can have stability issues. It is not everyone's cup of tea.

Having said that, Apple recently allowed 'sideloading', letting anyone download Xcode and push their
own apps to their own devices - without restrictions. You just need to have the source code and compile
it yourself. Ok, that works - I can stay on a recent version of the OS, not worry about jailbreaking,
and still run what I want.
